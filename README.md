# Softwares Custom Pi License - Version 1
## History
When i was developing command() and animatel() functions, i wanted to people use it if they were using any of copyleft licenses but no license were able to do that, so i invented a thing called
**Semi License** 
## What is a Semi License?
A semi-license is not a full copyright license by itself, but rather a licensing model that allows a work (such as software or an artistic creation) to be re-licensed only under a specific set of pre-approved 
licenses.
A semi-license:
- Contains a **list of compatible licenses** chosen by the copyright holder.
- Grants users the right to use, modify, distribute, and re-license the work under any license from that list.
- Forbids re-licensing under any license not included in the list.
- May optionally include standard legal disclaimers, such as "no warranty" or "limitation of liability."
**Characteristics:**
- A semi-license does not define copyleft, permissive terms, or copyright obligations by itself.
- Its main purpose is to **facilitate license compatibility** and allow the work to be integrated into different ecosystems (e.g., GPL, MPL, LGPL) without legal conflicts.
- The copyright holder can keep the list narrow (e.g., only GPLv3 and AGPLv3) or broad (e.g., GPL, MPL, LGPL, BSD, MIT, etc.).
**In short:**  
A semi-license = “You may only re-license this work under one of these listed licenses.”
## Usage
So, you can add or remove licenses as you want.
